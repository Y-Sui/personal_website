My name is Yuan Sui, and I am currently a junior student majoring in computer science from Shandong Normal University. In the past three years, I have devoted myself to researching Natural Language Process (NLP), specifically focusing on the interpretability of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graph-Based Question Answering (KGQA). In particular, I am interest in the research of KGQA as I am fascinated by the innumerable amount of facts embedded within the real-world knowledge graphs, which has hindered the access from regular users. And I am intrigued to seek beyond the complexity and volumes of those facts by fully exploring the capacity of KGQA to bridge that gap between users' demands and the complex knowledge graphs.
